我国是柑橘的主要原产国之一，也是世界上栽培柑橘*早的国家，有文字记载的栽培历史达4000 余年。近10多年来，柑橘生产发展迅速，面积不断扩大，柑橘病虫害的发生成为阻挠我国柑橘业健康发展的重大障碍，给果农带来重大的经济损失。
本书收集了包括生理病害和自然伤害等共63 种病害，其中细菌病害、病毒和类病毒病害、真菌病害及线虫病共32 种；虫害共171 种；天敌63 种。新增的病害4 种，虫害11 种。本书作者经过对柑橘病虫害的多年观察，拍摄病虫害照片，从中选取1500 余幅，以图为主、图文并茂的形式，编撰成此书，方便给生产者查阅。
本书可为我国柑橘产业的持续、健康发展做出贡献，也可供从事柑橘种植农户查阅对照及教学、科研、科普、技术推广工作者参考。
