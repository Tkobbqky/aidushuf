    《抛物问题的伽辽金有限元方法(第2版)》由(瑞典)托姆著，主要内容：the
basis of this work is my earlier text entitled galerkin finite
element methods for parabolic problems, springer lecture notes in
mathematics, no. 1054, from 1984. this has been out of print for
several years, and i have felt a need and been encouraged by
colleagues and friends to publish an updated version. in doing so i
have included most of the contents of the 14 chapters of the
earlier work in an updated and revised form, and added four new
chapters, on semigroup methods, on multistep schemes, on incomplete
iterative solution of the linear algebraic systems at the time
levels, and on semilineax equations. the old chapters on fully
discrete methods have been reworked by first treating the time
discretization of an abstract differential equation in a hilbert
space setting, and the chapter on the discontinuous galerkin method
has been completely rewritten.
