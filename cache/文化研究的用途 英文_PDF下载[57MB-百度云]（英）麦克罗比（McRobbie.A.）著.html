But what of the every-day actions and ways of living of peoples who have migrated and findthemselves carving out a living in the cities of the West？ Here is foundthe 'insurgent art of cultural translation'; here also is found a newnesswhich is again 'otherwise than modernity'. Moving between art and theexperience of migrant peoples, Bhabha points his readers to the domes-tic and affective realm which literature is able to conjure, 'unhomeliness'for example, or from Henry James the 'incredulous terror' of experi-encing displacement, of not being at home. From Nadine Gordimer heremarks on how everyday domesticity and the environment of 'thehome' became the very ground where the challenge to apartheid tookplace. Art and literature are capable of bringing into being intrinsicallyordinary intensities. The intimacy of experience where ruled and rulersco-exist reminds us of Gilroy making a similar point. Black people wereclose to and part of European modernity - in its bedrooms andkitchens - the backdrop to its conversations. It 'happened' in theirpresence. So there is no question of black people or migrants coming 'belat-edly' to modernity. Indeed Bhabha argues that the 'time-lag' by whichmodernity sought to distance itself from the perceived slowness of itsothers, is actually critical to modernity. It needed this temporality toachieve domination. By writing （or bringing） this exclusion back intomodernity as its condition of existence, or its constitutive outside, a dif-ferent kind of modernity can be arrived at, one which is not so unlikeGilroy's 'counter culture of Modernity'. This is, according to Bhabha,a way of speaking back from these necessary margins, or 'originalspaces', a 'post-colonial translation of Modernity', which disputes thepastness or slowness typically assigne</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
