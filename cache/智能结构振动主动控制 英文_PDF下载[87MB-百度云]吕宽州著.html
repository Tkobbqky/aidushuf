This book discussed common methods of vibration control 
technology and recent progress, which is dividedinto eight chapters. The first 
chapter introduced the development status and the present key technologies 
ofpiezoelectric smart structure vibration control. The second chapter focused on 
Piezoelectric Smart StructureDynamics using traveling wave method. The third 
chapter introduced the location optimized problems ofpiezoelectric 
sensor/actuator for Piezoelectric Intelligent Structure. The fourth chapter 
described the principle ofadaptive filter and LMS algorithm. The fifth chapter 
studied fiher-X adaptive control algorithm for active vibrationcontrol. Chapter 
six presented the Multiple Input Multiple Output Random Disturbance Control. 
Chapter sevenintroduced optimal control strategy for Multi-Input Multi-Output 
(MIMO) systems. Chapter eight presented thebuilding of intelligent structural 
vibration control platform, experiments were analyzed for structural 
vibrationcontrol methods studied in this book. 吕宽州编*的《智能结构振动主动控制(英文版)》is 
referred to vast scientific and technological personnel working on control 
science andengineering, aerospace engineering, manufacturing and automation, 
materials science and engineering, it can beused as a study book for the 
graduate and senior undergraduate in the above profession.
