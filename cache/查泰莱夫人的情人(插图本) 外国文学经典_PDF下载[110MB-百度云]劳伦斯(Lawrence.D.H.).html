  《查泰莱夫人的情人(插图本)》是劳伦斯的景后一部长篇小说。故事的主人公是一位年轻的已婚女性——查泰莱夫人康斯坦丝（Constance）。她上层阶级的丈夫范利福德（Clifford Chatterley）在**次世界大战中因负伤而导致下半身终身瘫痪。性生活无法满足的挫折使她开始邂逅一名猎场看守人奥刊弗·梅勒斯（Oliver Mellors）。书中描述了查泰莱夫人和她的情人之间的肉体关系，其中露骨的性爱描写和在当时属禁忌的猥亵用词引来许多评论家的非议。这个故事的灵感据称源自劳伦斯自己不快乐的家庭生活，故事发生的地点德比郡（Derbyshire）也是劳伦斯曾经居住过的地方。</p>]<p><h2>相关资料</h2></p>[<p>
  插图：He stayed that time only the three days, and to Clifford was exactly the same as on the first evening; to Connie also. There was no breaking down his external man.He wrote to Connie with the same plaintive melancholy note as ever, sometimes witty, and touched with a queer, sexless affection. A kind of hopeless affection he seemed to feel for her, and the essential remoteness remained the same. He was hopeless at the very core of him, and he wanted to be hopeless. He rather hated hope. 'Une immense esperance a traverse Laterre ,he read somewhere, and his comment was: 'and it's darned-welldrowned everything worth having.Connie never really understood him, but, in her way, she loved him. And all the time she felt the reflection of his hopelessness in her. She couldn't quite, quite love in hopelessness. And he, being hopeless, couldn't ever quite love at all.So they went on for quite a time, writing, and meeting occasionally in London. She still wanted the physical, sexual thrill she could get with him by her own activity, his little orgasm being over. And be still wanted to give it her. Which was enough to keep them connected.And enough to give her a subtle sort of self-assurance, something blind and a little arrogant. It was an almost mechanical confidence in her own powers, and went with a great cheerfulness.She was terrifically cheerful at Wragby. And She used all her aroused cheerfulness and satisfaction to stimulate Clifford, so that he wrote his best at this time, and was almost happy in his strange bind way. He really reaped the fruits of the sensual satisfaction she got out of Michaelis' male passivity erect inside her. But of course he never knew it, and if he had, he wouldn't have said thank-you!Yet when those days of her grand joyful cheerfulness and stimulus were gone, quite gone, and she was depressed and irritable, how Clifford longed for them again! Perhaps if he'd known he might even have wished to get her and Michaelis together again.</p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>
