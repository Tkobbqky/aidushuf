　　Terrorism and extremism are the common enemies of humanity， and the fight against terrorism and extremism is the shared responsibility of the international community. It is a fundamental task of any responsible government， acting on basic principles， to remove the malignant tumor of terrorism and extremism that threatens people's lives and security， to safeguard people's dignity and value， to protect their rights to life， health and development， and to ensure they enjoy a peaceful and harmonious social environment.<br/>　　Over the years， to ensure public safety and wellbeing， the international community has spared no effort and made tremendous sacrifices in preventing and combating terrorism and extremism. Many countries and regions， in light of their own conditions， have developed effective measures and drawn valuable lessons from these efforts.　　Terrorism and extremism are the common enemies of humanity， and the fight against terrorism and extremism is the shared responsibility of the international community.

Many countries and regions， in light of their own conditions， have developed effective measures and drawn valuable lessons from these efforts.<br/>　　Xinjiang is a key battlefield in the fight against terrorism and extremism in China. For some time Xinjiang has been plagued by terrorism and religious extremism， which pose a serious threat to the lives of the people in the region. Addressing both the symptoms and root causes and integrating preventative measures and a forceful response， Xinjiang has established vocational education and training centers in accordance with the law to prevent the breeding and spread of terrorism and religious extremism， effectively curbing the frequent terrorist incidents and protecting the rights to life， health， and development of the people of all ethnic groups. Worthwhile results have been achieved.
