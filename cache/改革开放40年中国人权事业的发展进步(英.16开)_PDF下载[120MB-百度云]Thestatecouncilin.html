It has made comprehensive progress in allhuman rights, ensured economic, social and cultural rights, and enhancedthe mechanisms guaranteeing civil and political rights.　　Signiflcant improvement in people’s lives. Between 1978 and2017, China’s GDP increased from RMB367.9 billion to RMB82.7 trillionand per capita GDP from RMB385 to RMB59,660, a 22.8-fold increase,or a real growth of 8.5 percent per year adjusted for inflation. Per capitagross national income rose from US$200 in 1978 to US$8,690 in 2017,above the average level of upper middle-income countries. The per capitadisposable income of urban and rural residents grew from RMB343 and RMB134 in 1978 to RMB36,396 and RMB13,432 respectively in 2017.In 2017, national per capita consumer spending was RMB18,322, an 18-fold increase over 1978 0r a real growth of 7.8 percent per year adjusted for inflation. The country is moving from a society based on subsistence to one based on plenty. The Engel coefficient of urban and rural households in 1978 was 5 7.5 percent and 67.7 percent, which fell to 28.6 percent and 31.2 percent respectively in 2017. China‘s human devel-opment index （HDI） value has risen significantly from 0.423 in 1980 to 0.752 in 2017, gradually moving into ranks of countries with higher HDI.Among the 47 bottom-ranked countries measured in 1990, China is the only one to have risen into the ranks of the “high human development”countries.　　Increased protection of personal rights and right to dignity. The Constitution confirms citizens’right to dignity. The 19th CPC National Congress again emphasized the protection of personal rights, property rights and right to dignity, demonstrating the humane view of protecting dignity and promoting the all-round development of the human being.General Principles of the Civil Law and Tort Liability Law further es-tablish the system of protection for right to dignity. “Civil rights” as one chapter is included in General Provisions of the Civil Law to elaborate right to dignity. In August 2018, right to dignity as an individual book was contained in the draft Civil Code.　　China has abolished the detention and repatriation system and the reeducation through labor system. It is now accelerating the reform of the household registration system. In 2014, Decisions on Furthering the Household Registration Reform released by the State Council relaxed the restriction on the transfer of household registration （hukou）, enabling eligible regular residents with stable employment in urban areas to local-ize their residency. In 2017, the urbanization rate of registered population stood at 42.35 percent, up 7 percentage points over 2012. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, more than 14 million people without hukou have completed household registration, basically bringing the entire population into the hukou system.　　Inviolability of residence, freedom of correspondence and information security are fully protected by law. In 2017, the public security agencies launched special programs to handle cases involving invasion of personal information to effectively curb personal information leakage.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　2018 marks the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up in China.The Communist Party of China （CPC） has led the people in carrying out this great new revolution in the new era -one that holds the key to the destiny of contemporary China. Reform and opening up has helped to lib-erate and develop social productive forces. It has opened up a path of so-cialism with Chinese characteristics， and ushered in a new chapter in the development of human rights.　　Over the four decades， the Chinese people have worked hard as one under the strong and coherent leadership of the CPC. Huge changes have taken place， and living standards have significantly improved. The Chi-nese nation has risen and become prosperous and strong.　　Over the four decades， the CPC has always prioritized the people’s interests， ensuring that reform is conducted for the people and by the people， and that its benefits are shared by the people， It has worked to safeguard the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people， respect human values and dignity， and promote the well-rounded development of the people.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
