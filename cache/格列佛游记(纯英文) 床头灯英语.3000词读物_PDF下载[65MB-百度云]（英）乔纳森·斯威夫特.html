The king's servants would bring me food and drink three times a day， as well as other things I might need.　　I also was told that I would have teachers to help me learn the Lilliputian language. This made me happy， because I wanted to talk with these amazing little people. I felt sure that I could learn the Lilliputians'language easily， since I had studied so many other languages in my travels.　　When the king finished speaking to me， he turned to leave. Some soldiers stayed behind and gathered around me. At first， I thought these soldiers were protecting the Lilliputians from me.However， I soon learned that the men were really protecting me from the Lilliputians! After a few moments， a group of the little people surrounded me and began to talk angrily. When they thought the soldiers weren't looking， a small group of men grabbed some stones and threw them at me.Although these stones were extremely tiny， I did not like being hit with them. I certainly did not want to be hit in the eyes.　　When the leader of the soldiers saw what was happening， he and two other soldiers came and tied up the men who had thrown the stones. After they had done these， the soldiers dragged them over to me so that I would punish them. The men looked terribly afraid， and I realized that I could punish them by scaring them a little. I made my face look red and angry and grabbed the group of prisoners.I was able to hold all the men in one of my hands.Quickly， I put them into the pockets of my shirt.Then I took one of the men in my hand and held him over my mouth as if I was going to eat him. 　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>《格列佛游记》是乔纳森·斯威夫特的一部杰出的游记体讽刺小说，以里梅尔·格列佛船长的口气叙述周游各国的经历。通过格列佛在小人国、巨人国、惠马国的奇遇，以荒诞而离奇的情节，揭露了当时英国统治阶级的腐败和罪恶。还以较为完美的艺术形式表达了作者的思想观念，作者用了丰富的讽刺手法和虚构的幻想写出了荒诞而离奇的情节，深刻地反映了当时的英国议会中毫无意义的党派斗争，统治集团的昏庸腐朽和唯利是图，对殖民战争的残酷暴戾进行了揭露和批判；同时它在一定程度上歌颂了殖民地人民反抗统治者的英勇斗争。</p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>　　乔纳森·斯威夫特（1667—1745），英国文学大师、政论家。　　生于爱尔兰都柏林。斯威夫特家境贫寒，出生前父亲就已世，由于母亲无力抚育，他在伯父的教养下长大。15岁时，就读于都柏林三一学院。21岁，前往英国做私人秘书，在此期间，他阅读了大量古典名著，为其之后的写作奠定了扎实的基础。35岁时，他从都柏林大学获得神学博士学位。两年后发表《书的战争》《桶的故事》，就此在文坛声名鹊起。　　43到46岁这段时间，斯威夫特卷入伦敦党派之争，写了大量反对战争和揭露时事的小册子。47岁时，时逢托利党失势，于是他重新回到爱尔兰，着手研究社会现状，积极号召爱尔兰的独立自由斗争。　　斯威夫特语言简洁犀利、辛辣幽默。1726年，长篇代表作《格列佛游记》问世，流传至今，影响了一代又一代的读者。　　1745年，78岁的斯威夫特病逝于爱尔兰都柏林。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
