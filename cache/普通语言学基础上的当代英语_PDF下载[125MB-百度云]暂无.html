    世界图书出版公司是国内*早通过版权贸易出版影印海外科技图书和期<br/>
  刊的出版机构，为我国的教学和科研作出了重要的贡献。作为读者，我自己<br/>
  也是得益于这项工作的人之一。现在世界图书出版公司北京公司打算引进出<br/>
  版一套“西方语言学视野”系列丛书，一定也会受到广大研究语言、教学语<br/>
  言的人士的欢迎。<br/>
    世界图书出版公司的宗旨是，把中国介绍给世界，把世界介绍给中国。<br/>
我认为，从总体上讲，在今后相当长一段时间内，把世界介绍给中国这项任<br/>
务还是主要的。西方的语言学在过去几十年里的发展和变化是很快的，新理<br/>
论、新方法、新成果很多，特别是在语言学和其他学科的交叉方面。跟我们<br/>
的近邻日本相比，据我所知，我们翻译、引进西方语言学著作无论在速度还<br/>
是数量上都是有差距的。不错，从《马氏文通》开始，我们就在不断地引进<br/>
和学习西方的语言学理论和方法，有人会问，这样的引进和学习还要继续到  ，<br/>
哪一天?其实，世界范围内各种学术传统的碰撞、交流和交融是永恒的，我<br/>
们既要有奋起直追的勇气、独立创新的精神，也要有宽广平和的心态。要使<br/>
我们的语言研究领先于世界，除了要继承我们传统中的优秀部分，还必须将<br/>
别人先进的东西学到手，至少学到一个合格的程度，然后再加上我们自己的<br/>
创新。<br/>
    这套丛书叫“西方语言学视野”，顾名思义，就是要开拓我们的视野。<br/>
  理论和方法姑且不谈，单就关注的语言而言，我们的视野还不够开阔，对世<br/>
  界上各种各样其他民族的语言是个什么状况，有什么特点，关心不够，了解<br/>
  得更少，这肯定不利于我们探究人类语言的普遍规律。我们需要多引进一些<br/>
  语言类型学方面的书，看来出版社已经有这方面的考虑和计划。我发现这套<br/>
  丛书中有一本是《历史句法学的跨语言视角》，另一本是《语法化的世界词<br/>
  库》，都是从各种语言的比较来看语言演变的普遍规律。还有一本是《语言<br/>
  与认知的空间——探索认知的多样性》，大概是从语言的多样性来看认知方<br/>
  式的多样性。这都是值得我们参考学习的。<br/>
     请专家给每本引进的书写一个导读，这是一个帮助一般读者阅读原著的<br/>
好办法。种种原因不能通读原著的人，至少也可以从导读中了解到全书的概<br/>
貌和要点。*后希望世界图书出版公司能不断给这套丛书增添新的成员，以<br/>
满足读者的需求。<br/>
 B. FUNCTIONAL SYNTAX<br/>
I. DEFINITION OF THE SENTENCE<br/>
The central issue of functional syntax is the problem of the sentence. It is<br/>
due to the fact that just as the basic element of the naming process is the word,<br/>
the basic element of the communicative process (of the process in which<br/>
naming units are brought into mutual relations) is the sentence.<br/>
   The substance of the sentence has been the subject of linguistic reflections<br/>
for many decades. As a result, there are a large number of definitions of the<br/>
sentence. In 1931 the German grammarian JOHN RIES published a book, Was<br/>
ist ein Satz ?., where he discusses some one hundred and fifty definitions of the<br/>
sentence, yet even his extensive collection does not exhaust all of Shem. We<br/>
must also define the sentence since it is difficult to proceed in syntax with<br/>
scientific precision without realizing what is to be regarded as the sentence.<br/>
We attempted to solve this problem by our definition of the sentence many<br/>
years ago (V. MATHESIUS 1924). We approached the sentence from the func-<br/>
tional point of view and examined it as a tool of communication. As was<br/>
explained on p. 13, an utterance constitutes either expression or communica-<br/>
tion. Expression is a mere manifestation of an emotion which does not reckon<br/>
with the hearer (we may express our feelings, as it were, against our will).<br/>
A communication, on the other hand, is a speech act directed towards the<br/>
hearer. The earliest beginnings of speech were presumably expressive, but the<br/>
known languages in their present form are based on communication. Hence it<br/>
appears suitable to treat the given problem from the viewpoint of the commu-<br/>
nicative function. If we approach the issue from this angle, we can give the<br/>
following definition of the sentence. The sentence is an elementary communi-<br/>
cative utterance through which the speaker reacts to some reality or several<br/>
items of the reality in a manner that appears to be formally customary and<br/>
subjectively complete.<br/>
   This definition requires some comments.<br/>
   1. The sentence is defined here as an elementary utterance in order to<br/>
be distinguished from a more extensive utterance that may include two or<br/>
more sentences.<br/>
   2. According to our definition, the speaker reacts to some reality in a certain<br/>
manner. In the act of sentence formation this active element is of prime im-<br/>
portance. Every sentence, if it is a sentence, reacts to some reality (the term<br/>
reality is here used in the widest sense of the word).<br/>
 FUNCTIONAL  SYNTAX<br/>
   3. The sentence reacts in a manner which -- as is stated in our definition --<br/>
appears to be formally customary (conventional). This means that every<br/>
language uses certain sentence patterns. Hence an elementary utterance<br/>
through which the speaker reacts to some reality is not a sentence unless the<br/>
utterance has a form that is common in the particular language. Let us imagine<br/>
that a foreigner with elementary knowledge of Czech says Venku prset [outside<br/>
to-rain]. It is undoubtedly an elementary utterance through which the speaker<br/>
reacts to the reality, but according to our definition it is not a sentence, since<br/>
the statement does not satisfy the requirement of formal conventionality.<br/>
   4. From the formal point of view, the above definition further requires the<br/>
sentence to be subjectively complete. This term calls for explanation. It<br/>
is different from objective completeness. It is not decisive whether the sentence<br/>
contains everything necessary to be understood and whether the hearer really<br/>
understands it; it suffices if the speaker considers it complete from his own<br/>
point of view. This completeness is indicated by the falling intonation of the<br/>
particular sentence.<br/>
   It should be pointed out that in one respect our definition is deficient. It<br/>
contains no reference to the process through which the sentence arises. Ex-<br/>
cessive emphasis laid on the genesis of the sentence was the weak point of the<br/>
definition given by WILHELM WUNDT (who stressed that through the sentence<br/>
we present an analysis of the reality [1922, pp. 243 ff.]) or by HERMANN PAUL<br/>
(who, on the contrary, proposed that through the sentence one carries out the<br/>
synthesis of certain elements [1920, pp. 121 ff.]). Both these genetic definitions<br/>
are defective in being inapplicable to one-element sentences; in contrast, the<br/>
functional definition presented above applies to one-element sentences equally<br/>
well as to two-element ones.<br/>
   Some scholars seem to think that our definition says too much. Thus VLA-<br/>
DIMIR SKALICKA 1935 does not share the view that structures of the type Venku<br/>
prset [outside to-rain] are not sentences in Czech. He claims that every utterance<br/>
through which the speaker reacts to some reality is a sentence. In our opinion,<br/>
however, the definition of the sentence should not exclude conventionality<br/>
of form if we are to remain within the bounds of the given language. The<br/>
definition given by Skalicka is "The sentence is an elementary semiological<br/>
reaction". The word reaction means that through it the speaker reacts to<br/>
some reality. The word elementary denotes the smallest possible extent of<br/>
the given reaction, while the attribute semiological indicates that the reac-<br/>
tion has been implemented by means of a certain system of signs. So far<br/>
everything is correct. The shortcoming of Skalicka's definition is, however,<br/>
that it does not remain within the bounds of language -- according to his<br/>
definition a sentence would also be constituted by someone's whistling in<br/>
a previously agreed manner. Thus, Skalicka's definition is not essentially<br/>
incorrect, but defines something much broader than the sentence ora language.<br/>
 II.  FUNCTIONAL  SENTENCE  ANALYSIS<br/>
          1. THE BASIS AND THE NUCLEUS OF A STATEMENT<br/>
The most important feature of the sentence is the reaction of the speaker to<br/>
some reality. In declarative sentences, which are merely a special, though the<br/>
most common, type of sentence, this active part of the speaker might be said<br/>
to be manifested in a certain assertiveness. A closer examination of sentences<br/>
from the viewpoint of assertiveness shows an overwhelming majority of all<br/>
sentences to contain two basic content elements: a statement and an element<br/>
about which the statement is made. This can best be seen in declarative sen-<br/>
tences. (For practical reasons we shall confine the scope of our discussion prima-<br/>
rily to this kind of sentence.) The element about which something is stated<br/>
may be said to be the b a s is of the utterance or the t h e m e, and what is stated<br/>
about the basis is the nucleus of the utterance or the theme.</p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>p&gt;【作者介绍】<br/>
