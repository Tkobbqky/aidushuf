"You are awesome." At first， foreigners who have just arrived in America are very happy and sometimes confused to be praised so many times for so many things.However， they will find later this is part of American culture.Americans consider it a virtue to compliment others.Americans believe that praise is more effective than criticism on encouraging people to better. 　　Future Orientation 　　Americans are generally less concerned about history and traditions than people from other societies are."History doesn't matter，" many of them will say， "It's future that counts." They look ahead.They move on.They are always looking forward to the improvement the future will bring.In many cultures， the future is considered to be in the hands of "fate" "God"， or at least the few powerful people or families dominating the society.However， Americans believe that humans， not fate， can and should control the environment.They work hard and achieve goals.Success in turn makes them more confident and optimistic about the future and about the change.Americans are good at planning short—term projects.With confidence and good plans， it is not surprising that they often make miracles.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　《新途径大学实用英语基础教程2（第2版）/“十二五”高职高专规划教材》设置了生动活泼的实用语句、简洁明快的地道篇章、丰富多彩的学习活动。希望学生能够通过这些轻松有趣的学习内容，把英语学习作为培养自身综合素质的平台，同时找到英语学习的乐趣，享受英语学习的过程。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
