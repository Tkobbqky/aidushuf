  插图：Santo's Paragraph to the College PresidentDear President Smith,I would like to express my concern about the severe parking problem that students face at River Community College. There are several reasons why I am concerned about this problem. First of all, students miss essential instructional time as a result of having to drive around the crowded parking lots looking for a parking space. These tuition-paying students miss quizzes and tests and also do not know what is going on in class when they arrive late. As a result, they do poorly in their classes. Also, it is dangerous for evening students to have to go far away to park their cars and to walk long distances to their classes. Another reason I am concerned is that some students have become so frustrated over the limited parking that they have begun fighting over parking spaces. Other frustrated students park their cars illegally in fire zones, which would be catastrophic if an emergency occurred.  If you do not realize how difficult the situation is for the students, you should, for one week, cancel all reserved parking spaces that are for college staff and have all the staff try to find parking. I think you should try to resolve this major problem by building a parking garage or by providing free shuttle buses from distant lots.</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
