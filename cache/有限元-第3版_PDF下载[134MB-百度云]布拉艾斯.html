<p>书名:有限元-第3版</p><p>作者:布拉艾斯</p><p>页数:365</p><p>定价:¥49.0</p><p>出版社:世界图书出版公司</p><p>出版日期:2012-03-01</p><p>ISBN:9787510042850</p><p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　this definitive introduction to finite element methods has
been thoroughly updated for this third edition， which features
important new material for both research and application of the
finite element method.<br/>
　　the discussion of saddle point problems is a lughlight of the
book and has been elaborated to include many more nonstandard
applications. the chapter on applications in elasticity now
contains a complete discussion of locking phenomena.<br/>
　　the numerical solution ofelliptic partial differential equations
is an important application of finite elements and the author
discusses this subject comprehensively. these equations are treated
as variational problems for which the sobolev spaces are the right
framework. graduate students who do not necessarily have any
particular background in differential equations but require an
introduction to finite element methods will find this text
invaluable. specifically， the chapter on finite elements in solid
mechanics provides a bridge between mathematics and
engineering.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
