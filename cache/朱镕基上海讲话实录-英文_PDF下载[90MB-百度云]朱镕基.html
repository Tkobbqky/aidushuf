All articles were personally reviewed by Zhu Rongji.<br/>　　Zhu Rongji's tenure in Shanghai coincided with the critical period when the focus of China's economic reforms shifted from rural areas to the cities， and when the economic system itself was in transition. For various domestic and international reasons， reform， development， and stability encountered great difficulties and daunting challenges. The Shanghai Years is an important record of this unique period. It clearly traces the course of the city's reforms and offers the reader a more comprehensive look at this phase of China's reform and modernization， as well as a deeper understanding of the theory and practice of soaalism with Chinese characteristics.
