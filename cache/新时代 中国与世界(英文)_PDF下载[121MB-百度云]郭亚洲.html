<p>书名:新时代:中国与世界(英文)</p><p>作者:郭亚洲</p><p>页数:202</p><p>定价:¥60.0</p><p>出版社:外文出版社</p><p>出版日期:2018-05-01</p><p>ISBN:9787119119946</p><p><h2>节选</h2></p>[<p>　　《新时代：中国与世界（英文）》：　　However， fascinated by statistical comparison between China and therest of the world， many people seem to ignore the key point： the greatestinfluence of contemporary China on the future international order or the greatest "benefit" brought by China to the international community is that China is contributing to the restoration of the "common sense"to the international community by practicing socialism with Chinese characteristic for a new era， by pursuing the "great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation" and promoting wodd pace， and by actively participating in talks on global issues and assuming international responsibilities.　　First， through a series of initiatives and diplomatic practices， China has made the international community realize that the well-being of the seven-billion wodd population should not be determined by merely two or three hundred million people. By imposing their own democratic values on other countries and maintaining global hegemony， a few western countries ignore the most basic democratic common sense -the majority rule， resulting in abnormal situations contrary to common sense——global economic and financial arrangements being decided by a few countries， commodity prices in the global market being set by monopoly firms， the culprits of the global financial crisis passing on the cost to the rest of the world without being held responsible， UN resolutions being ignored or even trampled by some great powers， etc.Many countries seem to have become accustomed to these strange situations， wl：ule some other countries are forced to accept them because they don't have other choices. However， China is not one of them. China has always adhered to the most fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter， including "non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries" and the principle that "all States are juridically and legally equal regardless of economic， social or political capacity." China also advocates autonomy of the African and Asian people. "No country should attempt to dominate regional security affairs.". China has set a good example by treating all other countries equally. In doing so， it has not only earned the respect of most countries but also drawn the global attention back to the importance of democracy in international relations.　　Secondly， China has been upholding the banners of peace，development， cooperation， and win-win outcomes， and lived by the motto One for All and A11 for One. If we take a look back at the history of humankind， we will find only by uniting together has Homo sapiens survived the harsh elements and threats from other species that were far more powerful than us in terms of physical strength and quantity and built splendid civilizations. But， nowadays， a small number of countries are stuck in the zero-sum game mindset trap.　　……</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
