Over the past thirty years, China has accomplished notonly earth-shaking transformation at home, but also historic changesin its relations with the rest of the world.It is against the backdrop of the ever deepening world multi-polarization and economic globalization that China has been carryingout its development. The development is naturally closely related tothe international environment.Grasping the opportunities provided by economic globalization,steadily deepening its reform and opening-up, and properly managinga variety of complicated challenges, China has made remarkableachievements in all endeavors of social and economic development.Thirty years is merely a brief moment in the long course of history.Yet, in just the twinkling of an eye, China realized its developmenton a weak foundation, uplifted its overall national strength, improvedits people's living conditions and turned itself into the world's thirdlargest economy. Admired by the world, China's sound and fastdevelopment is regarded as one of the greatest events in the nearlyhalf-a-century history of human development.</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
