<p>书名:换流变压器现场组装技术</p><p>作者:刘泽洪</p><p>页数:215</p><p>定价:¥70.0</p><p>出版社:中国电力出版社</p><p>出版日期:2017-05-01</p><p>ISBN:9787519806545</p><p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
本书是*本系统介绍换流变压器现场组装技术的专著。随着电压等级的大幅度提升，换流变压器的体积、质量也随之太幅提升，现有各种运输方式都无法实现换流变压器的整体运输。本专著从换流变压器自身出发，通过三种组装方案的经济技术比较， 系统论证现场组装技术的优越性和可操作性．本专著分为七章，包括综述、现场组装换流变压器、换流变压器油箱现场制造、换流变压器物料运输与存储、换流变压器现场试验、换流变压器现场检修和换流变压器临时油箱方案。
