Organizations as diverse as BP， Goldman Sachs， Southern Water， Toyota， Castlebeck Care Homes， Stockport's Stepping Hill Hospital and， of course， News International and the Metropolitan Police have all endured lost stakeholder trust in recent years. Yet Madeleine Bunting has queried —— correctly —— the prevailing despondency （消沉） about trust in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal. So， are we livingthrough a crisis of trust in organizations？ If so， what can be done about it？　　B）An analysis for the Institute of Business Ethics by Nicola Gillespie and I last year presented the latest research on repairing trust after organizational failures. The first thing to understand is trust itself. It may feel mysterious and elusive， but in fact we know a great deal about how it is formed and sustained， and recovered. The essential sequence is universal. To initiate trust， we must be worthy of it.　　C）Trustworthiness， in turn， consists of three main characteristics： technical competence to perform a task reliably （ability）， having benign motives （benevolence）， and acting according to acceptable ethical principles such as fairness and honesty （integrity）. Display these three attributes consistently and credibly， and you will be trusted by all but the most paranoid （偏执狂）. Get any ofthem wrong， and your reputation will suffer. Trust is remade —— strengthened or undermined —— inevery encounter.　　D）As with individuals， so with organizations. A trustworthy organization is one that operateseffectively， acts with due concern for the interests of its stakeholders and conducts itself with integrity.Support for trust and trustworthy employee conductneeds to be reinforced throughout the organization：　　by its leaders （role-modeling）， its culture （values andbeliefs）， its policies and procedures （task design，checks and balances， HR）， and managementpractices （targets， incentives， supervision）.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　《新支点大学英语快速阅读（4）》所选素材大多源自英语国家*新的报纸、杂志和主流网站。语言地道，内容新颖，体裁多样，题材广泛；素材话题涉及社会、家庭、教育、环保、健康、科技、职业、婚姻和体育等方面，贴近大学生生活，兼顾科学与人文知识，具有较强的知识性和趣味性。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
