SH wrote "Liangzhu-a Preliminary Report on the Black Pottery Cultural Site at the Second District of Hangzhou". He did not expect that this chance discovery unveiled the mystery of Liangzhu Culture, a splendid civilization in ancient time.　　In the following decades, the archeologists discovered a large quantity of black pottery and jade in Liangzhu and other areas. These sites were determined to belong to the late stage of Neolithic period. Besides, beginning from the 1950s, the archeologists from Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai discovered several sinular prelustoric sites near Taihu Lake Basin. Similar sites were also discovered sporadically as far as the north of Shaanxi and the south of Lingnan. The prehistoric culture was formally known as "Liangzhu Culture '.　　Eighty years have passed since the discovery of the Liangzhu Site at the end of 1936. In this period, the archeologists studied deeper and deeper about Liangzhu Culture. It is well established that Liangzhu Culture dated to about 5300 to 4200 years ago. It was an important culture in the Yangtze River Basin of late stage of Neolithic Period. It covered the vast area of northern Jiangsu in the north, Qiantang River in the south, Ningzhen region in the west and the East China Sea in the east. It was densely distributed in the area surrounding Taihu Lake. Liangzhu and Pingyao were the central locations of this culture. As far as the time sequence is concerned, Liangzhu Culture connected to Majiabang Culture of 6800-5700 years ago and Songze Culture of 5900-5200 years ago. It was a typical aboriginal culture.　　In such a vast place as China, a prehistoric cultural site dating to 5000 years ago could be found in many places.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　Hangzhou is a land of antiquity， beauty and wonders.Hangzhou is a land of antiquity. Archeological discovery shows that the trace of human activities in Hangzhou dates back to Paleolithic era. The fossil of a tooth discovered in Jiande dates back to about 100，000 years， the world's most ancient canoe of 8，000 years ago was discovered at Kuahuqiao. The ancient city of Liangzhu dates back to around 5，000 years ago and its dazzling jade culture all prove irrefutably that while other people still ate raw flesh and drank blood， the people in the area of Hangzhou were quite forward-looking. Their mode of production and spirit of life showed the evidence of childhood innocence and vitality. These prehistoric civilizations later merged with Chinese civilization as an organic whole. Hangzhou became one of the important sources of the 5，000 years of Chinese civilization.　　Hangzhou is beautiful. The charming West Lake is like a mirror wedged in the west of the downtown. Situated in the south of the city， Qiantang River with an extensive water face rushes eastward onto Hangzhou Bay. The Grand Canal cuts through the downtown from the north and merges itself with the sea through the river. Hangzhou is connected with rivers and lakes. Within the city， rows upon rows of mountains shoot up， with brooks and streams winding down to the lakes below.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
