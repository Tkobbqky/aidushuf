A planar curve could be drawn， its abscissa is time and its ordinate is trait value. The diagram shows that the trait changes continuously with time. At present， this work could be fulfilled by computers， curve can be drawn and its equation is given at the same time. However， the time of secondary xylem development is two directional growth ages， the diagram of development with time is three-dimensional curved surface. It is not suitable for secondary xylem development research directly; the expression shown by three-dimensional curved surface could be substituted by planar curve group of its different sectional views. What are those planar curves?　　The diagram of developmental change of secondary xylem with two directional growth ages is three-dimensional curved surface. That is substituted for the planar curve group of four types in this project， which are directly drawn from measured data. This treatment corresponds with mathematical principle. They are all the sectional views of the curved surface on different specific conditions. The developmental change expressed on the curved surface could be fully observed by those planar curve groups.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　次生木质部发育研究的内容是有关木材生成机理。这是林业科学的重要核心内容。植物学解决了木材逐年生成的共性细胞学过程，包括树茎顶稍初生生长至次生生长的连续转换。但树茎逐年次生生长中的变化却是林学和木材科学的学术盲区。单株树茎中的木材差异是树木在遗传控制下次生生长中的变化遗传物，但迄今把它与种内株间和种间在学术上都看作变异。这一误识充分表明，树茎逐年次生生长中的变化是木材生成机理中的重要部分。《木质部原理·次生木质部（1）：针叶树（英文版）》的新理念：认定单株内的木材差异是在生命过程变化中形成，并证明它受遗传控制，由此把这一变化定性为次生木质部发育。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
