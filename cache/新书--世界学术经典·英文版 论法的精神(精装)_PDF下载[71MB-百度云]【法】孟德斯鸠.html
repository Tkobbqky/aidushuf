《论法的精神》是孟德斯鸠*重要也是影响*的一部著作，被认为是自亚里士多德之后*本综合性的政治学著作。它以政治、法律为中心，广涉经济、社会、宗教、伦理、历史、地理等方面，是一部法学的百科全书。 全书分上下两册，共六卷三十一章。上册集中阐述作者的思想，如三权分立理论、政体与法律的关系、地理环境决定论等；下册则重在历史与考证，考证了法国历史上民法的罗马法与日耳曼法的渊源与流变，以及法国封建法律理论与封建君主制。作者在该书中不是在单纯地研究法律，而是试图阐述法的精神，即揭示各种社会现象以及自然现象自身的性质、状态及其对法律的影响。在孟德斯鸠看来，各国的法律背后都隐藏着各种相关的社会现象和自然现象。这些社会现象和自然现象的性质和状态都对法律存在着影响关系，它们就像灵魂、精神一样主宰着法律，此即“法的精神”。该书所阐述的政治法律思想对后世的政治法律实践有着深远的影响，对各国资产阶级政治和法律制度的确立及完善起到了极大的作用。美国独立战争中的《独立宣言》以及《美国宪法》、法国大革命中《人权宣言》都曾深受其影响。孟德斯鸠也因为这部著作被后世认为是社会学、政治学以及比较法学的创始人。
