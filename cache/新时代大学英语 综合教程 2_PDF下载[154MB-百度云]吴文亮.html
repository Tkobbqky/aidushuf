  插图：Attitudes to leisure have been much influenced by the modem love of moving around andby the ease of travel.The British enjoy the family outing. Most people choose well-known beauty spots, orseaside beaches, where they are often so crowded that you can't see the sand. Others choose alonely place, where there are very few people. They may follow tracks between the mountainsand lakes and watch seals （海豹） and seabirds. The British coast has many miles of cliffs andbeaches which are still quite unspoiled because building there is forbidden by law. So the coastis the most popular objective of English people for their holiday.Food in British hotels and restaurants is reasonably cheap, but rooms are not. The Englishpeople rent houses or flats for their holidays, but one of the traditional ways of spending asummer holiday is in a boarding-house. A house like this may have a card on its windowadvertising bed and breakfast. In seaside towns there are whole streets of houses, almost everyone of which has such a notice on its window.In recent years several new holiday habits have developed. Among them, the mostinteresting one is the growth of the so-called holiday camps. They consist usually of greatnumbers of small, and often quite comfortable, suburban houses, together with central dininghalls, dancing halls and swimming pools. Camping holidays with tents are not so well developedin England as in France. The summer weather too often can be very unpleasant for tent-dwellers.On the other hand, caravans （房库） have become exceedingly popular.</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
