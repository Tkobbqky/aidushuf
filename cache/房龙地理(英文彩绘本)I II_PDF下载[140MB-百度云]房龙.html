As hot air can hold much more vapor than cold air,the water-vapor will be carried along without much difficulty until theair grows colder. Then part of it gets condensed and falls back againupon the surface of the earth in the form of rain or hail or snow.The rainfall of any given region therefore will depend almost entirelyupon the winds to which it is exposed. If we have a sea-coast separatedfrom the mainland by mountains （a very common occurrence） the coastalregion will be wet and damp. For the wind, being forced to rise intohigher regions （where the pressure is lower）, will cool offas it gets furtherand further away from the sea-level and it will shed its vapor in the formof rain and snow and will reappear on the other side of the mountainrange as a dry wind without a drop of moisture.The rainfall of the tropics is both regular and abundant because theenormous heat of the land makes the air rise to a great height, where itgets cooled off and is obliged to let go of most of its vapor, whichthereupon returns to earth in the form of heavy sheets of rain. But asthe sun does not always stand right over the equator, but moves slightlyfrom north to south, most of the equatorial regions enjoy four seasons,two seasons during which there are terrific rainstorms and two seasonsduring which the weather is dryBut those regions which are exposed to steady air-currents runningfrom colder to warmer regions are by far the worst off. For as the windspass from the cold area to the hot one,their capacity for absorptionbecomes steadily greater and they are unable to release the vapor theycarr~ causing many parts of this earth to be turned into deserts whereit may not r</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
