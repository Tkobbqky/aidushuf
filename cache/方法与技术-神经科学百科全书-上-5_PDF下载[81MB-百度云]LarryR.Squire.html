  Mice pose advantages over other species，such as rats，dogs，pigs，or primates，in several aspects：（1）It ISrelatively easy to house large numbers of them；（2）the mouse genome is better characterized than that of anyother mammaI except humans；（3）many geneticallyaltered transgenic knockout and knockin lines andgenetically characterized mouse strains are availablefor crossbreeding and further genetic analysis；（4）cognitive studies can be done in appropriate strains of mice，such as C5786／SJL and 129S6，making the mespecially relevant to the study of AD；and（5）studies in invertebrates，while useful，willlack some relevance in pharmacological studies and pathogenic in vestige.Tions To create transgenic mice with salient features of AD.investigators must take care in several aspects of design and development.The most important factors are the selection of the gene or gene variant to be expressed，the promoter driving transgene expression,the background strain of the mice. and the levels and distribution of transgenic protein expression achieved in the brain.The mouse lines with the most robust neuropathological phenotypes have been developed using the method of pronuclear microinjection oftransgenes into fertilized ocytes（Figure 1）.B0th wildtype and variant human APP and tau genes have been used to generate mice that develop neuropathology related to AD.Transgenes containing mutations linked to aut osomaI dominant AD or FDTP generate morerobust neuropathology than transgenes encoding wild-type genes.Although mutations in presenilin一1 and presenilin.2 genes lead to early-onset ADin humans，mice expressing presenilin gene variants do not develop neuropathology per 5e.In the presence of human APP transgenes，howeve the presenilin gene variants accelerate plaque deposition in trans'genic mice.</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
